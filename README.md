A multi-language program that asks a series of questions in a survey form and prints the collected answers.

## Purpose

The purpose of Survey is to gauge the differences between several popular programming languages via basic string and integer IO. It also serves as an entry point for learning simply input and programming for a console.

## Compatibility

Survey runs on GNU/Linux, though it can be ported to Windows or other operating systems if needed.

### Software & Language Versions
Tested on Xubuntu 16.04.3 LTS x86_64 (64bit)/Linux kernel 4.10.0-33-generic, AMD platform. Compilers used are GCC (GCC & G++), Mono MCS compiler, Python 2 interpreter and Python 3 interpreter. Later versions were completed and run on Debian 9.3 Stretch with the same compilers and language packages. 

### Languages

Below is a list of programming language used to create Survey. Several were removed during the course of Survey's development. 

- C
- C++
- C#
- Go
- Python 2.x
- Python 3.x

## Archival & Cancellation

Survey's original purpose has been fufilled - the additional languages and support on operating systems has ceased; right now, Survey is finished and archived unless someone would like to fork it and expand on the code. The only tweaks might be a general housekeeping (spelling, formatting to documentation).
