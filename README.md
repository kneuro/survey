A multi-language program that asks a series of questions in a survey form and prints the collected answers.

## Purpose

The purpose of Survey is to gauge the differences between several popular programming languages via basic string and integer IO. It also serves as an entry point for learning simply input and programming for a console.

## Compatibility

Survey runs on GNU/Linux, though it can be ported to Windows or other operating systems if needed.

### Software & Language Versions
Tested on Linux Mint 20 x86_64 (64bit)/Linux kernel 5.9.12-050912-generic, AMD platform. Compilers used are GCC (GCC & G++), Mono MCS compiler, and Python 3 interpreter. Later versions were completed and run on Debian 9.3 Stretch with the same compilers and language packages.

### Languages

Below is a list of programming language used to create Survey. Several were removed during the course of Survey's development. Python 2 has been removed due to deprecation.

- C
- C++
- C#
- Go
- Python 3.x

## Revival & Continuation

Survey has been brought back from the dead. This section of the README.md file will be replaced eventually after the addition of Rust.
