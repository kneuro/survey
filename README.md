# Survey
A multi-language, cross platform program that asks a series of questions in a survey form and prints the collected answers.

# Purpose

The purpose of Survey is to gauge the differences between several popular programming languages via basic string and integer IO. It also serves as an entry point for learning simply input and programming for a console.

# Compatibility

Survey will run on Linux, Mac, Windows and BSD. Which versions of these operating systems Survey runs on is dependent on the installed software and dependencies.

## Software & Language Versions
Tested on Xubuntu 16.04.3 LTS x86_64 (64bit)/Linux kernel 4.10.0-33-generic, AMD platform. Compilers used are GCC (GCC & G++), Clisp (Lisp compiler, Common Lisp Dialect), Mono MCS compiler, Rustc compiler, Python 2 interpreter and Python 3 interpreter. 

# On Development

Survey, at the moment, is only developed with one branch (master, with the tag v0.0.01-alpha). This may change when the purpose of Survey has been fulfilled.
