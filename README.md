# Survey
A multi-language, cross platform program that asks a series of questions in a survey form and prints the collected answers.

# Purpose

The purpose of Survey is to gauge the differences between several popular programming languages via basic string and integer IO. It also serves as an entry point for learning simply input and programming for a console.

# Compatibility

Survey will run on Linux, Mac, Windows and BSD. Which versions of these operating systems Survey runs on is dependent on the installed software and dependencies.

## Software & Language Versions
Tested on Xubuntu 16.04.3 LTS x86_64 (64bit)/Linux kernel 4.10.0-33-generic, AMD platform. Compilers used are GCC (GCC & G++), Mono MCS compiler, Python 2 interpreter and Python 3 interpreter.

## Languages

Below is a list of programming language used to create Survey. Two were removed: Lisp and Rust. Lisp (Common Lisp) seemed out of place and couldn't be easily resolved to a binary and Rust still has a lot of bugs, syntax and development issues. Go (Golang), while much newer than the other languages, seems to be much more stable, so it was kept.

- C
- C++
- C#
- Go
- Python 2.x
- Python 3.x

# On Development

Survey, at the moment, is only developed with one branch (master, with the tag v0.0.01-alpha). This may change when the purpose of Survey has been fulfilled.
