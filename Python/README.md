Install Python 2.x or Python 3.x depending on which script you prefer to run.

[:Running:]

Install your preferred version via the Python official website. For Linux, Python should be in your repositories. If not, install from the website.

Open a CMD (terminal Linux/Mac/BSD) and type "python script_name" to run. Example:

> python python2_main.py

or

> python3 python3_main.py
